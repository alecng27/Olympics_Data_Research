The aim of this project is to examine the historical data of the Olympics across many different countries to discover whether winning at the Olympics influence fertility within those countries.

Specifically, the main question is: Does a country that perform significantly better in the Olympics, meaning they if they obtain medals, experience an observed increase in birthrate?
